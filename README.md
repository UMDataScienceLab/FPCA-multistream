# Functional Principal Component Analysis for Extrapolating Multistream Longitudinal Data

This repository includes R code for FPCA-GP proposed in the paper "[Functional Principal Component Analysis for Extrapolating Multistream Longitudinal Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9258998)" by S. Chung and R. Kontar. 

The advance of modern sensor technologies enables collection of multistream longitudinal data where multiple signals from different units are collected in real-time. Here the model aims to predict the future evolution of multistream signals from an in-service unit, based on historical data from other units previously operated. For more details, please find the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9258998).
